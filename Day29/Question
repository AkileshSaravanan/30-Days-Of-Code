Day 29: Bitwise AND | 30 Days Of Code 

Objective
Welcome to the last day! Today, we’re discussing bitwise operations.

Task
Given set S = {1, 2, 3, . . . ,N}. Find two integers, A and B (where A < B), from set S such that the value of A&B is the maximum possible and also less than a given integer, K. In this case, & represents the bitwise AND operator.

Function Description
Complete the bitwiseAnd function in the editor below.
bitwiseAnd has the following paramter(s):
– int N: the maximum integer to consider
– int K: the limit of the result, inclusive

Returns
– int: the maximum value of A&B within the limit.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.
Each of the T subsequent lines defines a test case as 2 space-separated integers, N and K, respectively.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 103
2 <= N <= 103
2 <= K <= N

Sample Input
STDIN   Function
-----   --------
3       T = 3
5 2     N = 5, K = 2
8 5     N = 8, K = 5
2 2     N = 8, K = 5

Sample Output
