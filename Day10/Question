Day 10: Binary Numbers | 30 Days Of Code

Objective
Today, we’re working with binary numbers.

Task
Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1‘s in n‘s binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

Example
n = 125
The binary representation of 12510 is 11111012. In base 10, there are 5 and 1 consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, 5.

Input Format
A single integer, n.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 106

Output Format
Print a single base-10 integer that denotes the maximum number of consecutive 1‘s in the binary representation of n.

Sample Input 1
5

Sample Output 1
1

Sample Input 2
13

Sample Output 2
2

Explanation
Sample Case 1:
The binary representation of 510 is 1012, so the maximum number of consecutive 1‘s is 1.
Sample Case 2:
The binary representation of 1310 is 11012, so the maximum number of consecutive 1‘s is 2.
