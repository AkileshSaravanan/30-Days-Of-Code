Day 9: Recursion 3 | 30 Days Of Code

Objective
Today, we are learning about an algorithmic concept called recursion.

Function Description
Complete the factorial function in the editor below. Be sure to use recursion.
factorial has the following paramter:
int n: an integer
Returns
int: the factorial of n
Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of 0.

Input Format
A single integer, n (the argument to pass to factorial).

Constraints
2 <= n <= 12
Your submission must contain a recursive function named factorial.

Sample Input
3

Sample Output
6
