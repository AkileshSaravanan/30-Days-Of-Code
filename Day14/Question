Day 14: Scope | 30 Days Of Code

Objective
Today we’re discussing scope.
The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is written as |a – b|. The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, elements, is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in elements.
The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array (elements) for storing N non-negative integers, and a public integer (maximumDifference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

Task
Complete the Difference class by writing the following:
A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the _elements instance variable.
A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in _elements and stores it in the maximumDifference instance variable.
Input Format
You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The locked Solution class in the editor reads in 2 lines of input. The first line contains N, the size of the elements array. The second line has N space-separated integers that describe the _elements array.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10
1 <= _elements[i] <= 100, where 0 <= i <= N – 1
Output Format
You are not responsible for printing any output; the Solution class will print the value of the maximumDifference instance variable.

Sample Input
STDIN   Function
-----   --------
3       __elements[] size N = 3
1 2 5   __elements = [1, 2, 5]

Sample Output
4

Explanation
The scope of the _elements array and maximumDifference integer is the entire class instance. The class constructor saves the argument passed to the constructor as the _elements instance variable (where the computeDifference method can access it).
To find the maximum difference, computeDifference checks each element in the array and finds the maximum difference between any 2 elements: |1 – 2| = 1
|1 – 5| = 4
|2 – 5| = 3
The maximum of these differences is 4, so it saves the value 4 as the maximumDifference instance variable. The locked stub code in the editor then prints the value stored as maximumDifference, which is 4.
